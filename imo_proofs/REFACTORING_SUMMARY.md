# IMO Proofs Refactoring Summary

## Objective
Refactor and compress Lean proof sources while maintaining correctness and theorem interfaces.

## Completed Work

### 1. Created Shared Library (ImoSteps.lean)
- **Lines**: 129
- **Contents**:
  - Rational inequality helpers (`rat_div_le_of_mul_le`, `rat_div_bound`)
  - Prime divisor helpers (`prime_divisor_cases`)
  - Factorial bound helpers
  - Division product bounds
  - Recurrence relation helpers for IMO 1985 P6
  - Custom tactics for rational arithmetic

### 2. Refactored imo_1992_p1.lean
- **Original**: 484 lines
- **Refactored**: 153 lines  
- **Reduction**: 331 lines (68% compression)
- **Key improvements**:
  - Replaced verbose proof steps with `calc` blocks
  - Used shared library helpers for prime divisors
  - Simplified rational arithmetic using modern tactics
  - Consolidated repetitive proof patterns
  - Better structured lemmas with clear separation of concerns

## Files Analysis

### Large Files (potential for refactoring):
1. **imo_1985_p6.lean**: 1356 lines - Complex NNReal recurrence relations
2. **imo_1978_p5.lean**: 645 lines 
3. **imo_2022_p5.lean**: 587 lines
4. **imo_2007_p6.lean**: 571 lines  
5. **imo_1974_p3.lean**: 514 lines
6. **imo_1992_p1.lean**: 484 lines âœ… (Refactored)

### Total Project Statistics:
- **Original total**: 6631 lines across all IMO proof files
- **Current reduction**: 331 lines from imo_1992_p1
- **Estimated potential**: 40-60% reduction possible for simpler proofs

## Techniques Used

### 1. Pattern Extraction
- Identified common proof patterns across files
- Created reusable lemmas in shared library

### 2. Modern Tactic Usage
- Replaced verbose manual proofs with `calc`, `gcongr`, `positivity`
- Used `field_simp` and `ring_nf` for algebraic simplification
- Applied `norm_cast` for type coercion handling

### 3. Proof Structure Optimization
- Combined related proof steps
- Eliminated redundant intermediate lemmas
- Used more powerful automation tactics

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Files for Refactoring**:
   - imo_1978_p5.lean, imo_2022_p5.lean (likely 40-50% reduction)
   - imo_1974_p3.lean, imo_2007_p6.lean (moderate complexity)

2. **Complex Files**:
   - imo_1985_p6.lean requires specialized handling due to NNReal types
   - May benefit from domain-specific helpers

3. **Build Process**:
   - All refactored files should maintain exact theorem interfaces
   - Use `lake build` to verify correctness
   - Keep original files for reference

## Next Steps
1. Continue refactoring remaining large files
2. Extract more common patterns to ImoSteps library
3. Document refactoring patterns for future maintenance
4. Consider creating domain-specific helper modules
