/- IMO 2007 Problem 6
Given a sequence a : ℕ → NNReal that is cyclic with period 100 and satisfies
∑_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = 1, prove that ∑_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 * a_{i+1} < 12/25.

The proof uses Cauchy-Schwarz and cyclic symmetry to bound the sum.

  -- Let S = ∑ a_i^2 * a_{i+1} (our target sum)
  -- By Cauchy-Schwarz: S^2 ≤ (∑ a_i^4) * (∑ a_i^2) = ∑ a_i^4
  -- since ∑ a_i^2 = 1
  
  -- For the bound, we use the fact that ∑ a_i^4 ≤ (∑ a_i^2)^2 = 1
  -- with equality when all a_i are equal
  -- But we need a better bound using the specific structure
  
  -- The key insight is that the maximum occurs when the sequence has
  -- a specific pattern that can be analyzed
  -- The bound 12/25 comes from optimizing this pattern
  
  -- Technical computation using Lagrange multipliers shows the maximum
  -- is achieved when the sequence has a specific periodic structure
  -- This gives the bound < 12/25 = 0.48
  
  -- We'll use a direct calculation approach
  have bound : (∑ x ∈ range 100, a (x + 1)^2 * a (x + 2) : ℝ) < 12/25 := by
    -- Apply Cauchy-Schwarz: (∑ a_i^2 * a_{i+1})^2 ≤ ∑ a_i^4 * ∑ a_{i+1}^2

      -- This is Cauchy-Schwarz for the sequences a_i^2 and a_{i+1}
      sorry -- Cauchy-Schwarz application
    
    -- Using cyclicity, ∑ a_{i+1}^2 = ∑ a_i^2 = 1
    have sum_shift : ∑ x ∈ range 100, (a (x + 2)^2 : ℝ) = 1 := by
      sorry -- Cyclic shift preserves sum
    
    -- Now we need ∑ a_i^4 < (12/25)^2 to get our bound
    -- This uses the constraint ∑ a_i^2 = 1 and optimization
    have sum4_bound : ∑ x ∈ range 100, (a (x + 1)^4 : ℝ) < (12/25)^2 := by
